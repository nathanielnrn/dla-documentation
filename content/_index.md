## Update Nov 2024: An article about this project has been [published](https://circuitcellar.com/research-design-hub/projects/catching-lightning-in-an-imu/) in Circuit Cellar!

We've made this site as a place to document the workings
of our motion controlled Diffusion Limited
Aggregation simulator we built using a Rasberry Pi RP2040. Click
the 'DLA' link above to learn more.

Feel free to reach out for a PDF version of issue 412 as well.
